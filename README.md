# ❄ 🎁 🎅 Advent of Code 2017 🎅 🎁 ❄

My AoC '17 solutions written in JavaScript that runs within Node.

My solutions will almost certainly not be the most optimized, best practices or
heck even actually work properly.

## JavaScript 👼

Run using Node 8 (or lower maybe, who knows!).

Run the days solutions using `node day1`, `node day2`, etc. Make sure to `npm install` first to make sure any deps are installed.

### Tests ☃

Run the tests (and automatically runs solutions for some reason) using `npm test
day1`, `npm test day2`, etc.
