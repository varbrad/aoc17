# AoC 17'

My Advent of Code 2017 solutions. Written in JavaScript, Python and whatever
else I decide to randomly use. http://adventofcode.com

### JavaScript

Run using Node 8 (or lower maybe, who knows).

Run the days solutions using `node day1`, `node day2`, etc.

Run the tests (and automatically runs solutions for some reason) using `npm test
day1`, `npm test day2`, etc.
